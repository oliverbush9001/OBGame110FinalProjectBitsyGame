# OBGame110FinalProjectBitsyGame
The final project for my Game 110 Class. I plan to make a videogame adaptation of Edgar Allen Poe's The Raven, or at least part of the poem. Game is made with Bitsy. 

Working Title: The Raven
Link to the Poem: https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven

Design notes and ideas: what are your current ideas or vision for how you can adapt this to Bitsy? Outline what the player does to complete the experience as a numbered walkthrough sequence.

My current idea is to use three rooms, the bed chamberm outside of the door, and outside the window. The player while go back and forth between them as the knocking of the Raven occurs. I might have it so depending on what you approach within the room, it may provide a description from the poem, but we will see with that. I'm not sure yet whether I just want the lines of dialogue from the poem to be the only dialogue in the game, or have the poem words be more ever present. I'm leaning towards the first option, as I want to make sure to give a feeling of loneliness and dread to the game, just like the source material. Some points of animation can be the raven, the purple curtains, and the tossing and turning of the player. 

Sequence of play: 
1. Player remains in bed for sometime, tossing and turning (will probably have a player button to do so). 
2. Tapping on the chamber door, triggers dialogue of Player dimissing the tapping
3. tapping continues, playing stands up and repeats the dialogue
4. Tapping will continue until player approachs the door, then the dialogue of them adressing the visitor will occur.
5. Player will open the door, nothing will be there. Prompt for player to call out "lenore?". Echo will return back to the player.
6. Player will return to bed. After a short delay, the tapping will return, this time from the window.
7. If player appraoches the window, the player will trigger some dialogue then open the window.
8. The raven will be there, and the player will have a block of dialogue with the raven. The raven will respond "nevermore".
9. Game will either end here, or (depending on time/motivation) the rest of the conversation with the raven will carry out.
